**2. App Exploration**
- **Suggestion 1: Introduce a Dummy Mode for Hands-On Experience**
  - **Observation:** New users may hesitate to engage with the app due to a lack of familiarity with its features and processes, especially when it involves handling finances.
  - **Proposed Improvement:** Provide a dummy mode or interactive walkthrough where users can explore the app’s functionality without linking their bank accounts or committing to transactions.
  For example, users could simulate savings through dummy transactions and visualize how round-ups or daily savings work.
  - **Reasoning:**
    1. **Builds Trust:** New users are more likely to engage if they can explore the app risk-free.
    2. **Enhances Onboarding:** Familiarity with the app’s features before real use improves confidence and reduces drop-offs during onboarding.
    3. **Educational Value:** A dummy mode can serve as a tutorial, demonstrating the app's value proposition clearly and effectively.

- **Suggestion 2: Enhance Current Progress Tracking Features**
  - **Observation:** The app provides savings balances and basic insights but could benefit from richer, more interactive visual tools.
  - **Proposed Improvement:** Expand the existing visualizations by introducing:
    1. Goal completion charts showing percentages.
    2. Trend analysis for savings growth over time.
    3. Interactive reports comparing different savings methods (round-ups, daily savings, etc.).
  - **Reasoning:**
    1. **Motivates Users:** Advanced insights inspire users to save consistently.
    2. **Adds Value:** Helps users make informed decisions on saving strategies.
    3. **Personalized Experience:** Tailored recommendations based on trends improve the overall experience.

**3. Product Optimisation**
--> Make the feature prominent on the app’s homepage with engaging visuals and messages like "Spin Now to Win Rewards!" or use pop-ups.
